[TIMELINE] Suggested Next Steps

To continue your DSA journey, consider the following plan:
1. Weeks 1-2: Focus on Linked Lists and Stacks & Queues.
2. Weeks 3-4: Dive into Hashing and Trees.
3. Weeks 5-6: Explore Graph algorithms.
4. Weeks 7-8: Begin Dynamic Programming concepts.
5. Weeks 9-10: Study Advanced Data Structures like Heaps and Tries.

Allocate time each week to practice problems related to these topics on platforms like LeetCode and Coding Ninjas.
